Privacy Policy for Jira Link Formatter
Effective Date: January 27, 2026

1. Overview
Jira Link Formatter is a productivity browser extension designed to help users copy Jira ticket information in a customized format. We value your privacy and have designed this extension to operate with the minimum amount of data required.

2. Data Collection and Usage
Jira Link Formatter does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. * User Data: We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other personally identifiable information.

Browsing History: We do not track your browsing history. The extension only interacts with the specific Jira ticket page currently open when you click the extension icon or use the keyboard shortcut.

Ticket Content: While the extension reads the Jira ticket ID and Title to format your link, this data is processed entirely locally within your browser. It is never sent to an external server.

3. Permissions Justification
activeTab & scripting: Used exclusively to read the ticket ID and title from the Jira page you are viewing and to place the formatted link onto your clipboard.

storage: Used only to save your formatting preferences (e.g., your chosen separators or brackets) so they are remembered for your next use.

4. Third-Party Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties. No data is ever sold or used for advertising.

5. Security
Because all data processing happens locally on your machine, your Jira information remains within your local environment.

6. Contact
If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact the developer via the support link on the Chrome Web Store or on GitHub.
